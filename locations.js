This +1 Progress applies for each related question they ask, each getting the response of a new book, until they have a list of 6 books (a total of +6 Progress).

<p>Under the floor of this location, there lurks a huge spider, an ambush-predator adapted to the Library\'s environment. It can lift up a section of floor, and emerge to grab prey, dragging it down to feed. It\'s burrow is just big enough to fit itself, and a few prey (either bundled up ready to eat, or still being subdued).</p>
<p>When the players first enter this location, describe the floorboards as being a little uneven, and that there are strands of cobweb over the floor. This is the only clue they get. If they test the floor, tell them there is a hollow space beneath. If they don\'t think to check, it\'s their own fault when they get ambushed.</p>
<p>The spider can sense the footsteps of those walking above it as vibrations and sound. It knows how many are present, if any are injured, and how heavy they all are. From this, it can make a good guess as to who makes the best victim. Typically, this will be whoever is bringing up the rear. Sometimes, it waits for a group of victims to disperse to explore the room, and grabs somebody who stands over its pit undefended.</p>
<p>When the spider makes its move, a section of floorboards lift up, and its front half (face and front legs) emerges from beneath. It grabs its victim and tries to drag them into its pit, closing the lid behind it.</p>
<p>It makes a single surprise attack. If the attack hits, the victim is pulled into the spider\'s pit and takes damage. Furthermore, there is a 3-in-6 chance that the spider does this quietly enough that (unless the victim states that they cry out) nobody notices it has happened unless they\'re looking at the victim.</p>

The mechanism links to a small metal grille in the front of the jar; this is how the brain within communicates in a tinny, staticky voice. The brains are torpid and dormant as the PCs enter, but can be roused by shaking their jars or speaking directly into the grille at the front of their jar, for example.</p>
