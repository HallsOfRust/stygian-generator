        <h1 id=index-title>The Stygian Library Generator</h1>
        <p>An automatic generator that follows the procedures and random tables detailed in <em><a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/257113/The-Stygian-Library">The Stygian Library</a></em> by <em>Emmy "Cavegirl" Allen</em>.</p>
        <p>To use the generator, click "Go deeper" to advance from the selected room. Select a different room to advance from that room instead. Click "Event" to generate an event appropriate for the selected room. Some rooms have conditions that affect which events are generated.</p>
        <p>Toggle between resting and exploring PCs by clicking the button named "PCs are exploring/resting". Toggle whether the PCs are considered visitors or intruders by clicking "PCs are visitors/intruders". These toggles both affects the types of events that are generated.</p>
        <p>Add manual connections between rooms or manually delete connections (or rooms) with the "Add connection" and "Delete selection" buttons.</p>
        <p>Finally, save and load your generated library with the "Save/Load" buttons.</p>
